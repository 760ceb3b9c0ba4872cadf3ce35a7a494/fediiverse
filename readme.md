use mastodon from the miiverse applet on your nintendo 3ds!!

the goal of this project is that its easy to use mastodon on your 3ds, but for now you need extensive technical knowledge
to set it up. so if you're interested and aren't ready for that, you cant use it yet. sorry!
(dont forget about the project though because when i do get it working you better be there to use it >:3)

if you wanna try setting it up then clone the repo and follow [these instructions](/docs/setup-server.md) and maybe together we can make it better :3  
feel free to contact me if your having any issues ill definitely help you out!
