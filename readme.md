# fediiverse (beta)
<i>Mastodon and the Fediverse for your Nintendo 3DS!!</i>

<a href="https://discord.gg/vb8K5Rwure"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord%20server-5865F2?logo=discord&logoColor=white"/></a>

fediiverse lets you access Mastodon and Fediverse from your Nintendo 3DS through the Miiverse applet. A fediiverse instance stands between your console and your Mastodon instance.

fediiverse has been tested on original and New 3DS models and should work on all homebrewed Nintendo 3DS family systems!  

**warning! fediiverse is beta software!! you have been warned! aaaaaaaahhhh!!!!**

## Get started
there is no single fediiverse instance. To get started with fediiverse, find a fediiverse instance and follow the instructions provided on the instance's welcome page. But no matter what instance you use, you will need to:
- Install the Luma3DS [custom firmware](https://3ds.hacks.guide/) on your 3DS.
- Install [Pretendo](https://pretendo.network/) or another Nintendo Network ID server replacement to your 3DS. (Miiverse will not launch unless your device can connect to NNID which was [shut down in April 2024](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/), so at this time fediiverse depends on an alternative service being installed.)
- Install the [fediiverse Setup Utility](https://git.gay/sheepy/fediiverse-setup/releases) to your 3DS.

A fediiverse instance has to act on your behalf with your Fediverse account, so you should trust it! [More information about security](/docs/security-considerations.md)  
(Your Fediverse instance admins could also provide a fediiverse server for your community, or you could host a fediiverse server just for yourself!)

## Hosting
See [setup instructions](./docs/hosting/setup-instructions.md) to host your own fediiverse instance.
